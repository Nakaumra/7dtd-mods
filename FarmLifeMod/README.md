# Installation

To install FarmLifeMod you *must* copy it into your `Mods` folder. Locations for `Mods` folders:

- [Mac OS X](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?101570-modlets-on-Mac)
- [Windows](https://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/How_to_Install_Modlets)

If you want custom icons for this mod then you *must* install [FarmLifeMod_Icons](https://github.com/stasis78/7dtd-mods/tree/master/FarmLifeMod_Icons). So with both mods installed, you should have 2 folders like this:

*Steam/steamapps/common/7 Days To Die/Mods/FarmLifeMod*

and

*Steam/steamapps/common/7 Days To Die/Mods/FarmLifeMod_Icons*

### Dedicated Server Notes

If `FarmLifeMod_Icons` is installed on a dedicated server then the client will need to install this mod locally in order to get the assets. This is a limitation of the current way mods are handled by the game.

## About

Here is a [guide](https://github.com/stasis78/7dtd-mods/blob/master/FarmLifeMod/FarmLifeMod.md) to FarmLifeMod. It explains at a high level what the mod does and hopefully gives some insight into the *why*.

## syn7572's FarmLifeMod_Icons

FarmLifeMod_Icons is only made possible by **syn7572**'s very hard work! They have full credit for all their work on the icons. I'm very grateful for their willingness to contribute to this mod.
