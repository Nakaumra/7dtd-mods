# Installation

To install FarmLifeMod you *must* copy it into your `Mods` folder. Locations for `Mods` folders:

- [Mac OS X](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?101570-modlets-on-Mac)
- [Windows](https://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/How_to_Install_Modlets)

If you want custom icons for this mod then you *must* install [FarmLifeMod_Icons](https://github.com/stasis78/7dtd-mods/tree/master/FarmLifeMod_Icons).

If you want custom models for this mod then you *must* install [FarmLifeMod_Models](https://github.com/stasis78/7dtd-mods/tree/master/FarmLifeMod_Models).

So with all the mods installed, you should have folders like this:

*Steam/steamapps/common/7 Days To Die/Mods/FarmLifeMod*
*Steam/steamapps/common/7 Days To Die/Mods/FarmLifeMod_Icons*
*Steam/steamapps/common/7 Days To Die/Mods/FarmLifeMod_Models*

### Dedicated Server Notes

If `FarmLifeMod_Icons` or `FarmLifeMod_Models` is installed on a dedicated server then the client will need to install these mods locally in order to get the assets. This is a limitation of the current way mods are handled by the game.

## About

Here is a [guide](https://github.com/stasis78/7dtd-mods/blob/master/FarmLifeMod/FarmLifeMod.md) to FarmLifeMod. It explains at a high level what the mod does and hopefully gives some insight into the *why*.

FarmLifeMod is a community project and anyone is free to offer suggestions on the [forums](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?104474-FarmLifeMod) or here on [GitHub](https://github.com/stasis78/7dtd-mods/issues).

## syn7572's work on FarmLifeMod_Icons and FarmLifeMod_Models

These mod additions are only made possible by **syn7572**'s very hard work! They have full credit for all their work on assets. I'm very grateful for their willingness to contribute to this mod.

## What does 'stable' mean exactly?

These developery terms are absolutely confusing, and also ambiguous, so I will try to explain.

For Farm Life, stable means that I will no longer be adding or removing any items, blocks, recipes, buffs, loot tables, or quests. I may modify existing things as bug reports come in or when Syn adds new assets.

What this means to *you* is that item tables will not change if you update to any version of 1.8.x. This means that you won't suffer from any unintended item shifting.

## What are you going to do now? Whats going to happen to Farm Life

Well FIRST I'm going to go play the game for a while. I've been focused on this mod for some time and need to take a break ;p

Seriously though. If bugs come up or Syn adds new assets, I'll post an update.

I have huge plans for the future and Farm Life v2 is going to be absolutely massive, easier to maintain, MUCH faster to add new items and recipes and growing things. It is not out of the question that I will add over 1000 items in total for version 2. Right now I need to build some tools to help me manage something on that scale. Manually editing xml files is not sustainable anymore :)

Till next time, enjoy!!!!!

:)
