# FAQs

These are frequently asked questions.

## Where do I get seeds?

Thats a wonderful question and appreciate that you asked.

Seeds for Farm Life are found just like vanilla seeds. You can loot them and buy them from traders. Trash piles, cupboards, and sinks are great places to look for them.

Once you have enough of the fruit or vegetable, you can craft them. For trees you MUST loot them or buy them though.

There are two different quests you can complete to get plant and tree seeds. You just need one piece of coal and one piece of paper for each. Complete these quests and gain a Crate that you can place and smash for seeds:

- Farming Crops (Seeds)
- Growing Trees (Seeds)

These are completely optional. If you want to just scavenge like vanilla, you will find all the seed eventually :)

## How do pens work? I'm really confused!

I'm sorry for the confusion. Let me try to make it very simple.

To raise livestock you do the following.

- Craft a Pen
- Place the Pen on the ground (they do not stack on top of each other)
- Craft a "Pitch Fork"
- Make either "Cattle Feed" or "Chicken Feed" (depends on whether a pen or a coop)
- Equip the Pitch Fork and then "upgrade" the Empty Pen/Coop
- Wait for the critters to finish eating and growing
- Harvest with a Machete or Knife for best results

Hope that clears this up!

## Ok, but the blocks for pens are really stupid. WTF is crates, boxes, and a dumb tarp? This mod sucks!

I'm sorry you feel that way. Let me try to explain it.

Right now adding models to the game requires client side downloads. I always strive to keep this so folks can run on dedicated servers without needing clients to download any "things". There will be models eventually, but they require the client to manually install them as of now.

To work around this issue, pens use the following logic for their block models.

- Empty pens are empty pallets, there is nothing in them
- Feeding pens use a tarp, there is something in there, but its not ready quite yet
- Full pens use boxes, there is definitely something in those boxes.

I'm sorry that the models are "stupid". If you have any suggestions for a better model, please leave a comment or post an issue here on GitHub!!

## How do I make Beer, Wine, and Spirits (like Whiskey or Vodka)?

I'm glad that you have the same interests that I do when it comes to libations! I have a treat for you :)

Brewing, wine making, and distillation are a big part of Farm Life. Below is a very crude sketch of the ideas involved. But first, there are a couple of things to understand. There are two stations and nine tools involved with crafting, as follows.

### Brew Cooker (hot, requires fuel)

- Masher
- Boiler
- Still

### Brew Station (cold, no fuel)

- Carboy
- Wine Tank
- Spirits Vat
- Wine Filter
- Oak Barrel
- Aged Oak Barrel
- Floor Corker
- Bottle Capper
- Mixing Cask

### Brew notes:

Beer:

Mix grains -> Masher -> Mash
Mash -> Boiler + hops -> Wort
boiled wort -> carboy ->  raw beer

(Optional) raw beer -> Oak Barrel -> Aged beer

raw beer -> Floor Corker -> white wine
Aged beer -> Floor Corker -> port


Spirts:

Mix -> Masher -> Mash
Mash -> Spirits Vat -> Raw Spirits
Raw Spirits -> Still -> Distilled Spirits

(Optional) Distilled Spirits -> Oak Barrel -> Aged Spirits

Distilled Spirits + water -> Mixing Cask -> vodka
Aged Spirits + water -> Mixing Cask -> whiskey


Wine:

Grapes -> KitchNaid -> Extract/Pulp
Extract/pulp -> Wine Tank -> Raw Wine
Raw Wine -> Wine Filter -> Filtered Wine

(Optional) Filtered Wine -> Oak Barrel -> Aged Wine

Filtered Wine  -> Floor Corker -> white wine
Aged Wine -> Floor Corker -> port

^^ Will refine into better notes soon ;)
